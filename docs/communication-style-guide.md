# Skillvee Communication Style Guide

## Brand Voice Overview

**Voice**: Light & professional — subtle wit that shows "we get it" without being goofy.

**Inspiration**: Linear meets Slack. Sharp, precise, insider knowledge.

**Core principle**: Write like two knowledgeable coworkers talking, not like a corporate slide deck.

---

## The Golden Rule

> **Conversational beats corporate. Always.**

If copy sounds like it came from a B2B enterprise pitch deck, rewrite it. If it sounds like something you'd actually say to a colleague who understands the problem, you're on track.

---

## Writing Principles

### 1. Show insider knowledge

Demonstrate that we understand the hiring pain from both sides — the hiring manager drowning in AI-generated resumes AND the engineer who's tired of inverting binary trees.

**Why it matters**: 72% of buyers choose brands that "get" them. Insider knowledge builds trust faster than features.

### 2. Be specific, not vague

| ❌ Vague | ✅ Specific |
|----------|-------------|
| "Boosts hiring performance" | "Reduces time-to-hire by 37%" |
| "Better than traditional tests" | "Bad hires cost $14,900 on average" |
| "Candidates hate it" | "Your coding test got leaked to Reddit last week" |

### 3. Lead with problems, not features

Use the **PAS framework**:
- **Problem**: Name the pain clearly
- **Agitation**: Twist the knife (lightly)
- **Solution**: Present how we fix it

**Example**:
- Problem: "Resumes are AI-generated now"
- Agitation: "You're screening 500 identical applications"
- Solution: "See candidates do real work before the offer"

### 4. Respect the reader's intelligence

Our audience knows their domain. Don't over-explain. Don't patronize. Get to the point.

---

## Tone Guidelines

### What we ARE

- **Confident** — We know this works. No hedging.
- **Direct** — Short sentences. Clear points. No fluff.
- **Witty** — Light humor through shared frustrations
- **Empathetic** — We understand the pain on both sides
- **Honest** — Acknowledge real problems, including ones the industry created

### What we're NOT

- **Goofy** — No dad jokes, no forced puns, no trying too hard
- **Corporate** — No buzzword bingo, no "leverage synergies"
- **Mean** — We're sharper than competitors, not meaner
- **Arrogant** — Confidence ≠ condescension
- **Generic** — If any hiring tool could say it, don't say it

---

## Humor Guidelines

### When humor works

- Mocking shared frustrations everyone recognizes
- Self-aware observations about the industry
- Light callbacks to developer culture
- Subverting expectations ("Plot twist:")

### When humor fails

- Forced or trying too hard
- Punching down at candidates or hiring managers
- Inside jokes only 10% of readers will get
- Any joke that requires explanation

### Approved humor examples

```
"Plot twist: The candidate who couldn't balance a binary tree might be your best engineer."

"Resumes used to mean something. Now they mean someone has ChatGPT."

"Ban AI tools in your test? Congratulations, you're testing who follows rules, not who can ship."

"Algorithm tests are dead. You just haven't buried them yet."
```

### Humor that's too much

```
❌ "HackerRank? More like HackerWreck!" (trying too hard)
❌ "Candidates be like..." (meme speak doesn't fit our voice)
❌ "RIP to your hiring process 💀" (too casual, emoji-dependent)
```

---

## Headlines & Structure

### H1 (Hero headline)

- **Under 8 words** (44 characters max)
- Punchy, memorable, benefit-focused
- No jargon, no features

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Stop interviewing. Start watching them work."
- ✅ "Stop guessing. Start seeing."
- ❌ "AI-Powered Work Simulation Platform for Technical Hiring" (feature dump)

### H2 (Section headers)

- Can be longer, but still conversational
- Avoid generic labels like "Features" or "Benefits"
- Use questions or provocative statements

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Why simulations > algorithm tests (other than the obvious)"
- ✅ "Your algorithm test has a problem: it doesn't work anymore"
- ❌ "Our Solution" (generic)
- ❌ "Platform Features" (boring)

### Body copy

- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- One idea per paragraph
- Use line breaks generously
- Lists > walls of text

---

## Audience-Specific Framing

### Primary: HR / Talent Acquisition

**Their pain points**:
- Drowning in AI-generated resumes (76% struggle to find qualified candidates)
- Time-to-hire averaging 44 days and climbing
- Bad hires destroying team morale (53% feel less engaged)
- Existing tools (HackerRank, etc.) not catching AI cheating

**Frame solutions as**:
- Screening efficiency
- Reduced time-to-hire
- Confidence in hiring decisions
- Risk mitigation ($14,900 average cost of bad hire)

### Secondary: Engineers / Technical Hiring Managers

**Their pain points**:
- Artificial puzzles disconnected from real work
- Candidates who interview well but can't perform
- Wasting time on redundant screenings
- Can't assess "soft" skills that actually matter

**Frame solutions as**:
- Seeing real problem-solving
- Better signal-to-noise ratio
- Less time wasted on bad fits
- Actually useful evaluation data

### Tertiary: Candidates (in content that reaches them)

**Their pain points**:
- Hazing culture in technical interviews
- Tests that don't reflect real work
- Non-reusable effort across companies
- Bias toward recent grads who "studied"

**Frame Skillvee as**:
- Fair evaluation of actual ability
- Chance to show real skills, not memorization
- Modern approach that respects their time

## Competitor Mentions

### The approach: Sharper, not meaner

We can be direct about why we're different. We don't need to trash competitors — just state facts.

### Positioning framework

| Competitor | Their approach | Our contrast |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| HackerRank | Bans AI, tests trivia | Can't ban AI from real work |
| CodeSignal | Generic "GCA score" | Scores don't show how people work |
| TestGorilla | 350 disconnected tests | Disconnected ≠ realistic |

### Example copy

```
"HackerRank, CodeSignal, TestGorilla were built for a different era.

They test what candidates memorized. We show you how they work."
```

### What NOT to do

- Don't be petty or snarky
- Don't make claims we can't back up
- Don't name-call or use dismissive language
- Don't spend more time on them than on us

---

## Words & Phrases

### Use these

| Word/Phrase | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| "See how they actually work" | Our core differentiator |
| "Work simulation" | Clearer than "assessment" |
| "Real work" | Contrast to artificial tests |
| "Before you hire" | Stakes are clear |
| "Can't be faked" | Addresses AI cheating directly |

### Avoid these

| Word/Phrase | Why | Use instead |
|-------------|-----|-------------|
| "Leverage" | Corporate speak | "Use" |
| "Utilize" | Same | "Use" |
| "Best-in-class" | Empty superlative | Specific claim |
| "Revolutionary" | Overused | Show, don't tell |
| "Seamless" | Meaningless | Be specific |
| "Cutting-edge" | Buzzword | Describe the actual tech |
| "Empower" | Vague | What actually happens? |
| "Holistic" | Corporate | "Complete" or be specific |

## Evidence & Social Proof

### Statistics we use

Always attribute sources (internally, know where numbers come from):

- **$14,900**: Average cost of a bad hire
- **76%**: Hiring managers who struggle to find qualified candidates
- **44 days**: Average time-to-hire (up from 30 days)
- **53%**: Employees who feel less engaged when working with underperformers
- **74%**: Companies that made a costly bad hire last year
- **52%**: Hiring managers who prioritize "access to candidates with right skills"

### How to present stats

Make them conversational, not clinical:

```
❌ "Statistics show that 76% of hiring managers report difficulty finding qualified candidates."

✅ "76% of hiring managers can't find qualified candidates. The other 24% are lying."

✅ "Bad hires cost $14,900 on average. The real cost? Your team's morale."
```

### Testimonials (when available)

- Keep them short (1-2 sentences)
- Include specific outcomes when possible
- Real names and companies build trust
- Avoid generic praise ("Great product!")

## Content Types

### Landing page copy

- Punchy headlines
- Short supporting text
- Clear CTAs
- Visual hierarchy matters — most important info first

### Blog posts / Long-form

- Action-oriented
- No personality required — just clarity
- Consistent terminology

### Email

- Subject lines: Under 50 characters, curiosity or value
- Body: Get to the point fast

## Checklist: Before Publishing

- [ ] Would I actually say this to a colleague?
- [ ] Is this specific, not vague?
- [ ] Did I lead with the problem, not features?
- [ ] Are headlines under 8 words?
- [ ] Is there any corporate speak to cut?
- [ ] Does humor land naturally (if used)?
- [ ] Is the CTA clear and singular?
- [ ] Would both a hiring manager AND an engineer feel "gotten"?

## Summary

**Remember**: We're building trust through insider knowledge and honest communication. We're not the slick enterprise vendor — we're the tool built by people who've been on both sides of broken technical interviews.

Write like you're explaining to a smart friend why the old way is broken and why this is better. Skip the marketing fluff. Be direct. Be specific. And occasionally, be a little funny about the absurdity we're all dealing with.
