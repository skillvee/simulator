# Skillvee Hackathon Pitch Video Script

**Total Duration:** 2:40 (160 seconds)
**Speaking Pace:** ~150 words/minute (natural, not rushed)

---

## Scene 1: Hook & Problem (0:00 - 0:25)

**[VISUAL: Stats appearing on dark background]**

> AI broke the hiring game.
> Seventy-four percent of resumes are now AI-generated. They all look the same.

**[VISUAL: Interview stats with 45%]**

> So companies responded with more interviews. But even interviews aren't reliable anymore.
> Forty-five percent of candidates use AI assistance during them.

**[VISUAL: "You're evaluating their copilot"]**

> You're not evaluating the person.
> You're evaluating their AI copilot.

**[VISUAL: Current tools failing]**

> HackerRank bans AI and tests trivia nobody uses at work.
> Take-homes? You can't tell who actually wrote the code.
> None of these answer the only question that matters: *can this person actually do the job?*

---

## Scene 2: Solution Reveal (0:25 - 0:40)

> For the first time, you can watch a candidate do real work... before you hire them. Candidates complete a 45 to 60 minute work simulation. They gather requirements. Collaborate with AI stakeholders. Write real code. Defend their decisions. Just like a real day at work.

---

## Scene 3: Candidate Experience (0:40 - 1:20)

**[VISUAL: Title "The Candidate Experience"]**

> Here's what the candidate sees.

**[VISUAL: Slack-style interface with sidebar]**

> They join a Slack-like workspace with their new "team."
> There's their manager, a PM, a tech lead — all AI-powered, but realistic.

**[VISUAL: Chat messages appearing]**

> The manager explains the task.
> The candidate asks clarifying questions. 
> They collaborate, just like they would on day one.

**[VISUAL: Voice call with floating call bar]**

> And they can hop on voice calls.
> Real conversations with Gemini Live powering natural, context-aware dialogue.

**[VISUAL: Code editor / work in progress]**

> They write code, use AI tools — we don't ban AI, we embrace it.
> Because that's how work actually happens now.

**[VISUAL: Completion screen]**

> Forty-five minutes later, simulation complete.
> Everything recorded. Ready for review.

## Scene 4: Recruiter Dashboard (1:20 - 1:50)

**[VISUAL: Title "The Recruiter View"]**

> Now here's what the recruiter sees.

**[VISUAL: Candidate overview with score]**

> An AI-generated scorecard.
> Overall score. Percentile ranking. Strength level.

**[VISUAL: Green flags / red flags]**

> Clear hiring signals.
> Where they shined. Areas to probe in the final interview.

**[VISUAL: Dimension score cards]**

> Breakdown by dimension.
> Communication. Problem-solving. AI leverage. Code quality.
> Each with observable behaviors and video timestamps.

**[VISUAL: Timestamp chips]**

> Click a timestamp, jump to that exact moment in the recording.

**[VISUAL: Candidate comparison]**

> Compare candidates side-by-side.
> No gut feel. Just evidence.

## Scene 5: Why Now - Gemini (1:50 - 2:05)

**[VISUAL: "Why is this possible now?"]**

> So why is this possible now?

**[VISUAL: Gemini capabilities - two cards]**

> Gemini.

> First: real-time voice conversations at scale.
> Gemini Live simulates realistic stakeholder conversations with memory.
> Coworkers remember what candidates said earlier.
> Before this required humans. Now it's async and infinitely scalable.

> Second: deep video analysis.
> Gemini's multimodal models analyze hour-long screen recordings.
> We see exactly how candidates work — what they did, how they used AI, where they got stuck.
> Before: impossible to review at scale. Now: automated and comprehensive.

---

## Scene 6: Team (2:05 - 2:25)

**[VISUAL: Title "The Team"]**

> Who's building this?

**[VISUAL: Team cards - German and Matias]**

> German Reyes. Two HR Tech exits acquired by Buk.
> Grew a startup from zero to one-point-four million ARR.
> Berkeley MBA.

> Matias Hoyl. Meta GenAI.
> Stanford Masters. Built Zapien with thirty-five thousand users.

**[VISUAL: "Why Us" points]**

> We've been building together for eight years.
> HR Tech exits — we know the buyer.
> Meta GenAI — we can build this.
> And this prototype? We ship fast.

---

## Scene 7: Closing (2:25 - 2:40)

**[VISUAL: Skillvee logo with glow]**

> Skillvee.

**[VISUAL: Tagline]**

> Watch them do Day One before you hire them.

**[VISUAL: CTA button]**

> Try the demo at skillvee.com.

**[VISUAL: "Built with Gemini" badge]**

> Built with Gemini.

## Notes for Recording

- **Tone:** Confident, conversational, not salesy. Like explaining to a smart friend.
- **Pace:** Natural pauses between sections. Don't rush the stats — let them land.
- **Emphasis:**
  - "Day One" — this is the key differentiator
  - "No gut feel — just evidence"
  - "We ship fast"
- **Energy:** Build through the video. Problem section is serious. Solution is hopeful. Product demo is exciting. Team is confident. Closing is strong.

- Speaking faster (but stay natural)

## Suggested Cuts if Needed

If the script runs long, cut in this order:
1. "Before: X. Now: Y" comparisons in Why Now section
2. Some dimension names in Recruiter section
3. Detailed team credentials (keep headlines)
