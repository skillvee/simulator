**Work simulation platform that lets hiring teams watch candidates do the actual job before they hire them**

*Powered by Gemini's real-time voice AI for stakeholder conversations and multimodal analysis to evaluate hour-long work sessions at scale.*

## The Problem

**Enterprise engineering teams are drowning.** Applications went from thousands per month to thousands per day. 74% of hiring managers now see AI-generated resumes—and they all look the same.

The response? **More interviews.** Rounds are up 42% since 2021. Engineering teams burn 38+ hours per hire across 4-5 rounds. The process takes 6 weeks. But even interviews aren't reliable anymore—45% of candidates use AI assistance during them. You're not evaluating the person; you're evaluating their copilot.

**Current tools make it worse.** HackerRank bans AI and tests trivia nobody uses at work. Take-homes? Candidates submit AI-generated code you can't distinguish from their own. None of these answer the only question that matters: *can this person actually do the job?*

## Our Solution

**For the first time, you can watch a candidate do Day 1 of the job before you hire them.**

Candidates complete a 30-45 min work simulation—gathering requirements, collaborating with AI stakeholders, delivering real output. Hiring teams get standardized evidence: scorecards, transcripts, work artifacts. Compare candidates side-by-side. No gut feel.

## Why Now: The 10x Unlock

**What Gemini makes possible that wasn't before:**

1. **Real-time voice conversations at scale** — Gemini Live simulates realistic stakeholder conversations (PM, manager, teammates) with conversation memory—coworkers remember what candidates said earlier. Before: required humans. Now: async, no scheduling, infinitely scalable.

2. **Deep video analysis of work process** — Gemini's multimodal models analyze hour-long screen recordings to see exactly how candidates work: what they did, how they used AI, where they got stuck, how they problem-solved. Before: impossible to review at scale. Now: automated, accurate, comprehensive.

## See It In Action

A candidate joins. They get a voice call from their "manager" explaining the task. They ask clarifying questions over Slack. They code, research, problem-solve—screen recorded the whole time. They defend their work in a final call with a "tech lead."

45 minutes later, you have: a full recording, AI-generated scorecard, code review, and transcripts of every conversation. You're watching their actual work—not their interview performance.

## Market & Defensibility

**Beachhead:** US enterprise teams hiring 5+ engineers/month. Highest pain, existing budget (HackerRank replacements), easiest to score. Expand to Product roles next.

**Model:** Monthly subscription—Free → $79/mo → $199/mo → Enterprise (~$80-100K/yr).

**TAM:** $3B pre-hire assessment market (HackerRank, CodeSignal, TestGorilla) growing >16%/yr.

**Day 1 edge:** HackerRank tests algorithm trivia nobody uses at work—and bans AI, pretending it doesn't exist. We test real work and let candidates use AI the way they actually will on the job. Better signal, built for 2025.

**Moat:** Every simulation generates behavioral data. As we track which hires succeed, we build a prediction engine no competitor can replicate. HackerRank can copy the product; they can't copy the data. Long-term: we become the industry standard for skills-based hiring.

## Traction Plan

Demo video will show a candidate completing a full voice-driven assessment—high "demo magic" factor. Distribution: LinkedIn (Matias has 20K followers in AI/edtech), Twitter, relevant Discord/Slack communities. The "watch someone talk to AI coworkers" format is inherently shareable.

## Team

**German Reyes (CEO)** — 2 HR Tech exits (acquired by Buk). Grew startup from $0→$1.4M ARR. GPM at Walmart eCommerce. Berkeley MBA.

**Matias Hoyl (CTO)** — Meta GenAI. Stanford MS. Built Zapien (35K users). 2x Stanford Learning Design winner.

We met 8 years ago at German's first startup. We've been building together for the last 1.5 years.

**Why us:** HR Tech exits (we know the buyer) + Meta GenAI (we can build this) + this prototype (we ship fast).
