Senior Full-Stack Engineer — Streamline (Series B, $45M raised)

About Streamline

Streamline is a modern project management platform built for engineering teams. We help development teams plan sprints, track velocity, and ship software faster. Think of us as the next generation of Jira — built for developers, not project managers. We serve over 2,000 engineering teams including companies like Notion, Linear, and Vercel.

Our stack: TypeScript end-to-end, React + Next.js frontend, Node.js + Express API layer, PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, Redis for caching and real-time features, deployed on AWS with Docker/ECS.

The Role

We're looking for a Senior Full-Stack Engineer to join our Core Platform team. You'll own significant features from design through deployment, working across our React frontend and Node.js backend. This is a high-impact role where you'll shape the product used by thousands of engineering teams daily.

What You'll Do

- Build and ship features across the full stack — from database schema design to pixel-perfect UI
- Own the real-time collaboration system (presence indicators, live cursors, concurrent editing)
- Design and implement REST and WebSocket APIs consumed by our web and mobile clients
- Improve application performance — we obsess over sub-200ms page loads and smooth 60fps interactions
- Collaborate closely with product, design, and fellow engineers in a small, autonomous squad
- Participate in architecture discussions and help set technical direction
- Mentor junior engineers through code reviews and pairing sessions

What We're Looking For

- 5+ years of professional software engineering experience
- Deep expertise in TypeScript, React, and Node.js
- Strong understanding of relational databases (PostgreSQL preferred) and data modeling
- Experience with real-time systems (WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or similar)
- Comfortable with cloud infrastructure (AWS, Docker, CI/CD pipelines)
- Track record of shipping features end-to-end in a fast-paced environment
- Excellent communication skills — you write clear PRs, docs, and Slack messages
- Product intuition — you think about the user experience, not just the code

Nice to Have

- Experience with Prisma or similar ORMs
- Familiarity with Redis for caching and pub/sub
- Experience building collaborative/multiplayer features
- Contributions to open source projects
- Experience at a high-growth startup (Series A-C)

What We Offer

- Competitive salary ($180K-$220K) + equity
- Remote-first with optional NYC office
- Unlimited PTO + company-wide shutdown weeks
- $3K annual learning budget
- Top-tier health, dental, and vision insurance
