# Ralph Progress Log

## Issue #169: RF-001 - Set up testing infrastructure for recruiter-focused flow

### What was implemented
- Added test users: `recruiter@test.com` and `candidate@test.com` (both with role USER until RF-002 adds RECRUITER role)
- Created test scenario `test-scenario-recruiter` with "Test Recruiter Company" and a manager coworker
- Created test assessments: `test-assessment-welcome` (ONBOARDING status) and `test-assessment-working-recruiter` (WORKING status)
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_SKIP_SCREEN_RECORDING` environment variable support
- Created `src/test/fixtures.ts` with exported constants for all test data
- Created `src/test/helpers.ts` with login command generators for agent-browser
- Created `.env.example` documenting all environment variables including test flags
- Updated `src/test/CLAUDE.md` with new test data documentation

### Files changed
- `prisma/seed.ts` - Added recruiter/candidate users, scenario, and assessments
- `src/lib/core/env.ts` - Added NEXT_PUBLIC_SKIP_SCREEN_RECORDING variable and shouldSkipScreenRecording() function
- `src/components/assessment/screen-recording-guard.tsx` - Use shouldSkipScreenRecording() instead of isE2ETestModeClient()
- `src/contexts/screen-recording-context.tsx` - Use shouldSkipScreenRecording() instead of isE2ETestModeClient()
- `src/test/fixtures.ts` - New file with test constants
- `src/test/helpers.ts` - New file with login helpers
- `.env.example` - New file documenting all env vars
- `src/test/CLAUDE.md` - Updated documentation

### Learnings for future iterations
- The codebase already had `NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E_TEST_MODE` for bypassing screen recording; the new `NEXT_PUBLIC_SKIP_SCREEN_RECORDING` is more targeted
- `shouldSkipScreenRecording()` checks both flags for backward compatibility
- Test assessment status uses ONBOARDING as placeholder for WELCOME (which will be added in RF-002)
- Test user role uses USER as placeholder for RECRUITER (which will be added in RF-002)
- The seed script is idempotent - uses `upsert` for all entities

### Gotchas discovered
- The `isE2ETestModeClient()` was being used in multiple places; replaced with `shouldSkipScreenRecording()` for clarity
- Environment variables need both server (`E2E_TEST_MODE`) and client (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`) versions for Next.js
